## **Autors**
Jann Basso

## **Technologies used for this part**
- PHP
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / Github

## **Result**
(need deployment)


## Goal
Get older project done in Bootstrap ([check here](https://github.com/jann-basso/restaurant-css-framework-new)) and add backend PHP features to it. See below:


#### Back office
One of the idea the owner had was to implement a "Back office" to the website. The objective is to receive all the messages from the form on a single page to facilitate the work of marketing and communication. From this interface you can **view** the messages and **delete** them.


#### Guest book
The owner would like to have a new [guest book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guestbook) page to receive comments, kind words or advice from the customers. However, it ideally need to be made with the **google sheet API** to allow the owner to check everything directly from his *google account*.

**If you find that it is too early to take an interest in API's you can proceed as for the previous form and use your database.**

The form should at least contain:

- customer name
- visited restaurant
- visit date
- comment (optional input)


#### Gallery
For the moment the images in your gallery are not dynamic. To add a photo you must add them one by one in your html code. What if I told you "Hey marketing and communications hired a photographer, there are 4000 photos to add to the gallery!"?

The objective is twofold. First create a page to upload images.
Secondly create a php script that allows you to display the images (Normally the front of your gallery does not change).

#### Bonus
Use only one page to manage messages, guestbook and gallery

#### Deploy
This is the opportunity to deploy your project. As you have probably noticed, github does not allow php hosting. There are free solutions. It's up to you to find them and share them with your colleagues!
